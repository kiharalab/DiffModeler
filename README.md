## Introduction

<details>
   <summary>DiffModeler is a computational tool using a diffusion model to automatically build full protein complex structure from cryo-EM maps at 0-20A resolution. </summary>

Cryogenic electron microscopy (cryo-EM) has been widely employed in experimental settings to determine 
multi-chain protein complexes, but modeling accuracy greatly diminishes when resolution 
decreases. At intermediate resolutions of 5-10 Å, even template-based structure fitting presents
significant challenges. To tackle this issue, we introduce DiffModeler, a fully automated protein complex structure modeling
method that leverages a diffusion model for backbone tracing and structure fitting with AlphaFold predicted single-chain structure.
In extensive testing on cryo-EM maps at intermediate resolution, DiffModeler showcased remarkably accurate
structure modeling, surpassing existing methods significantly. 
Notably, we successfully modeled a protein complex consisting of 47 chains,
comprising 13,462 residues, with an impressive TM-Score of 0.9. 
We also further benchmarked DiffModeler for maps at low resolution of 10-20 Å and 
validated its generalizability with plausible performances.

## Overall Protocol 

<details>

1) Backbone tracing from cryo-EM maps at intermediate resolution via diffusion model.  
2) Single-chain structure prediction by AlphaFold.  
3) Single-chain structure fitting using VESPER.  
4) Protein complex modeling by assembling algorithms.

<summary>Protein Structure Complex Modeling with provided template</summary>

### Protein Structure Complex Modeling with provided template 
This is for DiffModeler running if you have map and available template candiates (either from experimental or AlphaFold predicted structure).
It is fine to run if you only know some of the template structures..
```commandline
python3 main.py --mode=0 -F=[Map_Path] -P=[Single_chain_structure_dir] -M=[protin_config_path] --config=[pipeline_config_file] --contour=[Contour_Level] --gpu=[GPU_ID] --resolution=[resolution]
```
[Map_Path] is the path of the input experimental cryo-EM map, [Single_chain_structure_dir] specifis the directory of all single-chain PDB files. You can also zip them into a zip/.tar/.tar.gz file here to pass the zip file path here. [protin_config_path] is the text file path that records the protein single chain PDB name and corressponding chains, [pipeline_config_file] is the pipeline's parameter configuration file, saved in ``config`` directory; [Contour_Level] is the map density threshold to remove outside regions to save processing time (suggested to use half author recommended contour level), [GPU_ID] specifies the gpu used for inference. [resolution] specified the map resolution, where 0-2A will skip the diffusion model. Therefore, you can use an approximate resolution value here. <br>

If you want to use domain-based structure modeling, you can simply add the ``--domain`` option. The program will first call SWORD2 to split each single chain into different domains and then model structures using these domain structures. Alternatively, you can use [SWORD2_server](https://www.dsimb.inserm.fr/SWORD2/index.html) to explore different domain splitting choices and provide the domain structureS as single-chain structures to DiffModeler Here DiffModeler can model protein complexes based on the domain templates you provide.

Example of PDB config file
```commandline
tmp1.pdb A B
tmp2.pdb C
tmp3.pdb D E
```
which indicates 5 single-chain structures are provided. tmp1.pdb is for identical chain A and B, tmp2.pdb is for chain C, tmp3.pdb is for identical chain D and chain E.
To obtain such template/alphafold predicted single-chain structure, please consider two options:

1. Please check <a href='https://alphafold.ebi.ac.uk/'>AlphaFold Database</a> for single-chain structure with UniProt ID. <br>
2. Please simpy search <a href='https://www.ebi.ac.uk/Tools/sss/fasta/'>EBI Search Tool</a> aginst structure database to find most similar structures as templates for us to model protein complex. Here you can get similar (or even identical) experimental single-chain structures or AlphaFold predicted structures.<br>

After running the script, the generated cif file will be kept under ``Predict_Result/[map_name]/DiffModeler.cif``. The fitting score of each single chain is saved in occupency field of the cif file. If you want to visualize the fitting score, you can simply run the following command in PyMol after loading the cif file
```
spectrum q, red_white_blue,  all, 0,1
```
Here blue indicates good fitting chains and red indicates chains may not fit well. <br>
You can also specify ``--output`` as your output directory for your job.

### Example Command
```commandline
python3 main.py --mode=0 -F=example/6824.mrc -P=example -M=example/input_info.txt --config=config/diffmodeler.json --contour=2 --gpu=0 --resolution=5.8
```
This is the example command with ``-P`` specify the directory of single-chain pdbs.

You can also use this command line to specify the zip file including all single-chain PDB files for ``-P``
```commandline
python3 main.py --mode=0 -F=example/6824.mrc -P=example/6824.zip -M=example/input_info.txt --config=config/diffmodeler.json --contour=2 --gpu=0 --resolution=5.8
```

### Protein Structure Complex Modeling with sequence (EBI-search)
This is for DiffModeler running if you have map and corresponding sequence. It is fine to run if you only know some of the sequences.
<br><b>Please use our [server](https://em.kiharalab.org/algorithm/DiffModeler(seq)) if with more than 4 non-identical chains. </b> EBI's API is too slow to respond when you have many non-identical sequences. <br>

```commandline
python3 main.py --mode=1 -F=[Map_Path] -P=[fasta_path] --config=[pipeline_config_file] --contour=[Contour_Level] --gpu=[GPU_ID] --resolution=[resolution]

<summary>Training diffusion model in DiffModeler</summary>

### Training diffusion model in DiffModeler
To help adapt the diffusion model in DiffModeler for other purposes, we also released the training script and instructions here.
#### 1. Dataset Preparation
The dataset should be prepared in a directory [data_path] (keep in mind that you will use later), where the directory organization should be organized as
```
-[EMD-ID1]
  --input_1.npy
  --output_1.npy
  --input_2.npy
  --output_2.npy
  ...
-[EMD-ID2]
  --input_1.npy
  --output_1.npy
  --input_2.npy
  --output_2.npy
  ...
...
```
Here each sub-directory is the training input/target pairs collected from different EM mpas. The ``input_[k].npy`` and ``output_[k].npy`` corresponds to ``k``th exampls's input and target. Their shape should be [K,W,H], K indicates the number of channels, W refers to the width of the box, H refers to the height of the box. <br>

The map ids [EMD-ID] used for training and validation should be prepared in a txt file, with each line records one [EMD-ID]. This record txt file should be saved in [info_txt_path]  (keep in mind that you will use later). 

#### 2. Training Your own model
Depends on which channel of ``K`` channels you will use in the prepared file, you can specify them in [config/diffmodeler_train.json](config/diffmodeler_train.json).
```
"data": {
        "input_channel": [0],
        "output_channel":[0] //to support multi-channel training examples you have
    },
```
This is a list configuration for both input and output, you can add many channels as you want. If you changed to more channels, please also update network configuration accordingly.
```
"unet": {
            "in_channel": 3,
            "out_channel": 1,
            ...
```
After proper configuration, you can then train your model with the following scripts:
```
python3 train.py -F [data_path] --info_txt [info_txt_path] --config config/diffmodeler_train.json --gpu [gpu_id] --output [output_path]
```
[data_path] and [info_txt_path] is the path that you configured the training data path and records path. <br> 
[gpu_id] specifies the GPU used for training diffusion model. <br>
[output_path] is the path that you specified to save the training log and models.  <br>

If you wanted to change other configurations for better training, you can modify optimizer, network architecture, learning rate etc. in the configuration json file: ``config/diffmodeler_train.json`` <br>

</details>


<details>
<summary>Evaluate modeled structure by DiffModeler</summary>

#### 1. Convert .cif to .pdb
First convert .cif format to .pdb format via maxit: [install maxit](https://sw-tools.rcsb.org/apps/MAXIT/index.html)<br>
Then run the following command to convert DiffModeler.cif to  DiffModeler.pdb:
```
maxit -input DiffModeler.cif -output DiffModeler.pdb -o 2
```
For big structure that with more than 9999 residues, please reindex residue id from 1 for each chain. Otherwise, the conversion may lead to incorrect evaluation results.

#### 2. Evaluation by MMalign
You can choose to install MMAlign or run it online: [MMalign](https://zhanggroup.org/MM-align/). <br>
Then run the following command to compare DiffModeler.pdb with native.pdb.
```
./MMalign  DiffModeler.pdb native.pdb >report.txt
```
The evaluation metrics are available in report.txt.<br>
The TM-score is the 2nd one, which is normalized by the 2nd structure(native.pdb). <br>
The Align Ratio is calculated by dividing the reported align length by the length of the native structure. <br>
The sequence identity is calculated by Seq_ID*Align-Ratio.
</details>

## Example

<details>

### Input File
Cryo-EM map with mrc format. 
AlphaFold/Template single-chain structure and information file to indicate the path.
Our example input can be found [here](https://github.com/kiharalab/DiffModeler/tree/master/example)


## Notice
The newer version of Intel MKL will cause pyTorch to give the following error due to a symbol being removed: ImportError undefined symbol: `iJIT_NotifyEvent` is encountered.

We have updated the environment.yml and requirements.txt to fix the version to an older version. Any previous installation should work just fine.

If you have ever encountered this issue, please activate the conda env first and run `conda install mkl==2024.0`.

### Output File 
DiffModeler.cif: a CIF file that records the final modeled protein complex structure.
Our example output can be found [here](https://kiharalab.org/emsuites/diffmodelder_example/output). All the intermediate results are also kept here.
